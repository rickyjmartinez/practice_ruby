# 1. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.
# x = 11

# if x == 10
#   p 0
# else
#   p -1
# end

# 2. Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints -1 if the number is less than 10, prints 1 if the number is greater than 10, and prints 0 if the number is equal to 10.

# x = 10

# if x < 10
#   p -1
# elsif x > 10
#   p 1
# elsif x == 10
#   p 0
# end

# 3. Use variables to store two numbers, then write a condition that prints 1 if the numbers are both less than 10, and prints 0 otherwise.
x = 5
y = 7

if x < 10 && y < 10
  p 1
else
  p 0
