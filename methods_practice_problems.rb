# 1. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word with all capital letters.

# puts "please enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp.upcase
# p word

# 2. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints "That's a big number" if the number is greater than 100.

# puts "please enter a number"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i
# if number > 100
#   p "that's a big number"
# end

# 3. Write a program that asks the user to enter two numbers, then prints the numbers added together.

# puts "please enter two numbers"
# number1 = gets.chomp.to_i
# number2 = gets.chomp.to_i
# p number1 + number2

# 4. Write a program that asks the user to enter a word, then prints that word in reverse order.

# puts "please enter a word"
# word = gets.chomp.reverse
# p word

# 5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a number, then prints the number times 10.
# puts "please enter a number"
# number = gets.chomp.to_i * 10
# p number

# 6. Write a program that asks the user to enter two words, then prints both words on the same line in all capital letters.
puts "please enter two words"
word1 = gets.chomp
word2 = gets.chomp
p word1.upcase + " " + word2.upcase
